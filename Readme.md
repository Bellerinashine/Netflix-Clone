# Netflix Clone

This is a simple Netflix clone built with HTML and CSS. It replicates the basic layout and design of Netflix's home page, including a navigation bar, movie banners, and a grid of movies with hover effects. This project is a great way to practice front-end development and get familiar with building responsive layouts using CSS.
